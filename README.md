# Healthcare-Project
This project explores a cardiovascular dataset with 14 attributes and over 4,000 records to identify key risk factors linked to heart disease. Exploratory data analysis and logistic regression are applied to predict the likelihood of heart attacks. Visualisations and dashboards are used to support the insights gained.
